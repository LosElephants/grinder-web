# Project Elephant

The goal of Project Elephant is to provide a clever, yet occasionally forgetful, consumer with a passive, accurate, and user-friendly means to track the amount of material traveling through an herb grinder. This data is then presented to the consumer via an online dashboard or mobile app, for easy analysis of consumption over different time periods.

## The Grinder
Pick it up, grind it up, put it down.

## The App
Keep an eye on your spending, habits, and trends.

## The Endless Possibilities!
Ok not really, the application is pretty specfic.
